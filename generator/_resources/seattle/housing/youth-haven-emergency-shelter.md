Youth Haven serves as short term emergency placement for homeless youth and for state involved youth through the Children's Administration. Our agency owned Youth Haven home is a licensed staffed residential home for up to 12 youth. We provide safe, stable, temporary living alternatives to youth who are dealing with family crisis. The agency offers counseling and referral services to assist in the first steps toward family reconciliation or finding a safe, stable housing alternative.

For immediate help, youth may call the 24-hour hotline listed below. It connects them with trained staff who determine whether the caller is eligible for placement and make referrals, when appropriate, to other programs.
