StrongHearts Native Helpline is a 24/7 safe, confidential and anonymous domestic, dating and sexual violence helpline for American Indians and Alaska Natives, offering culturally-appropriate support and advocacy.

You can also [visit their website](https://strongheartshelpline.org/) and tap the chat button to chat with someone if calling doesn't work for you.

StrongHearts advocates are [mandatory reporters](#mandatory-reporters), but as an anonymous helpline, they do not have the information necessary to make reports.
