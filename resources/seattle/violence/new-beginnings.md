The New Beginnings Helpline is available for anyone who is experiencing abuse and/or is worried about someone they know. You may not know if what you are experiencing is abuse, that’s ok, they can help. If you are a service provider or employer and are worried about one of your patients or employees, call this for tips on how to best support that person. Parents or school personnel who are concerned about a teen can call to get advice on how to talk to them about healthy relationships and/or to offer them support. Any adult or teen, regardless of gender, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, race, color, religion (creed), national origin (ancestry), disability, marital status, or military status.
