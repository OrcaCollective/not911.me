Trans Lifeline provides trans peer support for our community that’s been divested from police since day one. They're run by and for trans people.

**Oprima 2 para hablar con unx operador en español.**

When you call:
- You’ll speak to a trans/nonbinary peer operator
- Full anonymity & confidentiality
- No nonconsensual active rescue (calling 911, emergency services, or law enforcement)
