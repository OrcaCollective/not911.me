Safe Place is a national program that provides on-site case management and support to **youth ages 12-17** to find a safe place to sleep, including transportation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. King and Snohomish counties have safe place programs that can collaborate if a minor is in Snohomish and needs to go to King, and visa versa. For a list of all Safe Place locations, visit <https://www.nationalsafeplace.org/where-is-safe-place>.

* Safe Place can also provide information and support to young adults (18+) or other agency staff over the phone, but cannot meet adults in person or provide transportation.
* Text “SAFE” and your current address/location to `4HELP` (44357) for the nearest Safe Place site where you can wait safely for a Safe Place staffer or call <a href="tel:18004228336">1-800-422-TEEN (8336)</a>.
