StrongHearts Native Helpline is a 24/7 safe, confidential and anonymous domestic, dating and sexual violence helpline for American Indians and Alaska Natives, offering culturally-appropriate support and advocacy.

You can also [visit their website](https://strongheartshelpline.org/) and tap the chat button to chat with someone if calling doesn't work for you.

StrongHearts advocates are mandatory reporters, but as an anonymous helpline, they do not have the information necessary to make reports. **If you want to avoid a report being made, please stay anonymous.**
