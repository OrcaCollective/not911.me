The 24-Hour Crisis Line provides immediate help to individuals, families, and friends of people in emotional crisis. We can help you determine if you or your loved one needs professional consultation and we can link you to the appropriate services.

If requested, a trained mobile response team will do a wellness check in person, <strong>without cops</strong>.
