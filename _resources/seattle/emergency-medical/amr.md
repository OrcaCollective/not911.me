**DISCLAIMER: _AMR works with the cops_**

For behavioral health situations you can potentially limit this possibility by suggesting that the Mobile Crisis Team might be helpful.

AMR may require the cops to "secure the scene" at their discretion (like if someone has a weapon or is deemed otherwise "dangerous").
