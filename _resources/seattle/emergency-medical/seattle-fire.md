**DISCLAIMER: _Seattle Fire works with the cops_**

For behavioral health situations you can potentially limit this possibility by suggesting that the Mobile Crisis Team might be helpful. Seattle Fire also has their own internal response team called "Health One" that they may or may not choose to dispatch.

Seattle Fire may require the cops to "secure the scene" at their discretion (like if someone has a weapon or is deemed otherwise "dangerous").
