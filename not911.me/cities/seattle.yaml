    The <em><a href="/12things-screen.pdf" target="_blank">12 Things To Do Instead of Calling the Cops</a></em> zine was also a great inspiration for some of the text on this page. Please check that zine out for more ideas of how to avoid bringing the cops into your communities!

    The <em><a href="/alt2police.pdf" target="_blank">what to do instead of calling the cops during mental health crisis and why they might show up anyway</a></em> zine also has some really good information about who to call instead of the police and some problems with those resources.
